# seq2point-nilm
**Sequence-to-point (seq2point) Toolkit non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM)**

This repository contains an implementation of Seq2Point models for Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM), based on the approach introduced in the paper:

Mingjun Zhong, Nigel Goddard, Stephen Sutton, and Charles Gillan (2018).
"Sequence-to-Point Learning with Neural Networks for Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring"

The code has been adapted from the original implementation by Mingjun Zhong: https://github.com/MingjunZhong/seq2point-nilm.

The project aims to provide a toolkit that standardizes benchmarking for the latest seq2point architectures across various energy datasets, providing performance metrics (mean absolute error, signal aggregate error and inference time) in an easy to compare format across multiple datasets such as REDD, REFIT and UKDALE.
